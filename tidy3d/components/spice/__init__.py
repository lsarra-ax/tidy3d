"""
This directory includes shared component SPICE definitions that could be compiled from a RF lumped element or a TCAD component.
The idea is that, ultimately, each component model can be compiled into an electrical element cleanly and used to create
a SPICE model.

All of the types in this directory should follow the standards defined in this documentation:
