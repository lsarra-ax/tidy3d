"""
This directory corresponds to the standard electronic interfaces that should be shared across multiple solvers.

The aim is to provide a standard translation interface between SPICE solvers and our own solvers.
Note: the API definitions in this section correspond to electronic frequencies (ie sub terahertz and that
can be represented by standard electronic circuit elements (including RF lumped elements).
